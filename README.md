<h1>ATM Mini-Project</h1>
<p>This project was a culmanation of all my skills when I did it a few months ago.
It doesn't adhere to best practices, it's just a checklist of features I could use in 
c++ back then. I'm happy to say, I'm far better than I was when I made this but, it's good to keep it in memory... a milestone of sorts</p>
